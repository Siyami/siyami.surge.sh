    <p>
      I'm excited to start my education at Galvanize and learn about full stack
      web development. I've always wanted to become a developer so this a dream
      come true. I hope to finish my education sucessfully, make good friends
      and find a job as a developer.
      I hope this will be a start of a very good journey for everyone!
